DATABASE TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL .


1)READ COMMITTED ISOLATION LEVEL (DEFAULT)
2) SERIALIZABLE ISOLATION LEVEL
3) READ-ONLY ISLOLATION LEVEL


1)READ COMMITTED ISOLATION LEVEL:

In the read committed isolation level, which is the default, every query executed by a transaction sees only data committed before the query—not the transaction—began. This level of isolation is appropriate for database environments in which few transactions are likely to conflict.

EXAMPLE:-
SAM'S SALARY IS 22000 IN THE DATABASE.

TRANSACTION:

UPDATE TAB SET SALARY =25000 WHERE ....... ;

COMMIT;

UPDATE TAB SET SALARY =32000 WHERE ....... ;

COMMIT;

UPDATE TAB SET SALARY =36000 WHERE ....... ;
COMMIT;


2) SERIALIZABLE ISOLATION LEVEL:

SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

In the serialization isolation level, a transaction sees only changes committed at the time the transaction—not the query—began and changes made by the transaction itself. A serializable transaction operates in an environment that makes it appear as if no other users were modifying data in the database.

SAM'S SALARY IS 22000 IN THE DATABASE.
TRANSACTION:

UPDATE TAB SET SALARY =25000 WHERE ....... ;

COMMIT;

UPDATE TAB SET SALARY =32000 WHERE ....... ;

COMMIT;

UPDATE TAB SET SALARY =36000 WHERE ....... ;
COMMIT;
